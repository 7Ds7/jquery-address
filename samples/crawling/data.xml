        <h1>Making AJAX Applications Crawlable</h1>
        <p>If you're running an AJAX application with content that you'd like to appear in
        search results, we have a new process that, when implemented, can help Google
        (and potentially other search engines) crawl and index your content.
        Historically, AJAX applications have been difficult for search engines to
        process because AJAX content is produced dynamically by the browser and thus not
        visible to crawlers. While there are existing methods for dealing with this
        problem, they involve regular manual maintenance to keep the content up-to-date.</p>

        <h2>What the user sees, what the crawler sees</h2>
        <p>In recent years, more and more of the web has become populated with AJAX-based 
        applications, replacing static HTML pages. This is a great development for users 
        because it makes applications much faster and richer. But making your application more 
        responsive has come at a huge cost: crawlers are not able to see any content that is 
        created dynamically. As a result, the most modern applications are also the ones that 
        are often the least searchable.</p>

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>This document outlines the steps that are necessary in order to make your AJAX 
        application crawlable. Once you have fully understood each of these steps, it should 
        not take you very long to actually make your application crawlable! However, you do 
        need to understand each of the steps involved, so we recommend reading this guide in 
        its entirety.</p>

        <h2>Overview of Solution</h2>
        <p>Briefly, the solution works as follows: the crawler finds a pretty AJAX URL (that 
        is, a URL containing a #! hash fragment). It then requests the content for this URL 
        from your server in a slightly modified form. Your web server returns the content in 
        the form of an HTML snapshot, which is then processed by the crawler.</p>

        <h1>How do I create an HTML snapshot?</h1>
        <h2>Generating HTML snapshots</h2>
        <p>As long as your app observes the URL mapping and HTML snapshot scheme described in the 
        <a href="specification.html">Specification</a> section, your app is visible to the crawler. 
        It <em>does not matter</em> whether</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>your app uses any Google technology (for example, 
            <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>, 
            <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>, 
            <a href="http://code.google.com/closure">Closure</a>)</li>
            <li>your app uses a specific JavaScript library (for example, 
            <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a>, 
            <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a>)</li>
            <li>your app uses a specific server-side technology (for example, 
            <a href="http://php.net/index.php">PHP</a> or <a href="http://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET</a>)</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>The only requirement is that your app uses AJAX. But otherwise you wouldn't be reading 
        this.</p> 
        <p>It's impossible to document all the different ways web applications can be developed. 
        There are too many web frameworks, libraries, and so forth to enumerate. Likewise, there are 
        many ways to create HTML snapshots, and which way is best for your application depends entirely 
        on how your web app is implemented. Let's discuss some common scenarios.</p>
